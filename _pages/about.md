**About Me**

I’m fascinated by **how viruses, bacteria, and their hosts interact across different scales**—from molecular mechanisms inside a single cell to the evolutionary forces shaping entire populations. My research explores **how different partners—virus-virus, bacteria-virus, and host-microbe-virus interactions—unfold across these levels**, with a special focus on **mosquitoes and insect-specific viruses**. These hidden dynamics shape viral ecology, vector biology, and the broader evolution of infectious diseases.

I thrive on **collaboration and creativity**, designing new ways to study these complex relationships while mentoring the next generation of researchers. Beyond research, I’m deeply committed to building an **inclusive and diverse** scientific community, believing that science flourishes when people from different backgrounds and perspectives come together. Through **volunteering roles in advocacy and mentorship**, I work to support early-career researchers and push for better policies in academia, ensuring a more equitable and dynamic research environment.

For me, science is about **curiosity, interactions, and impact**. I love diving into **fundamental questions about how viruses persist, evolve, and interact with their hosts**—but what excites me just as much is knowing that these discoveries could, in time, help **rethink vector control strategies** or reveal new ways to disrupt virus transmission. Whether it’s tracing viral interference at the cellular level or uncovering ecological patterns across mosquito populations, each new piece of the puzzle opens up more questions, more connections, and more possibilities to explore.
