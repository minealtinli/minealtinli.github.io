*I believe that a healthier academic culture is only possible through the active contributions of researchers at all levels. As part of that, I try to support a more inclusive, transparent, and fair system—through advocacy, peer support, and policy discussions. You’ll find some of my thoughts on the academic system and culture change  <a href='https://minealtinli.github.io/posts'>here</a>.*
