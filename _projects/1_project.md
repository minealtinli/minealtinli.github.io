Both insect-specific viruses (ISVs) and arboviruses can persist and sometimes coexist in mosquito cells. While arboviruses are known for their ability to infect and be transmitted by mosquitoes, ISVs remain restricted to insect hosts. In some cases ISVs can interfere or facilitate the arbovirus infections, however why this happens and what are the interaction mechanisms are unknown.

To better understand these dynamics, my research investigates:

- How ISVs establish long-term infections and persist in mosquito cells over time.
- The mechanisms of virus-virus interactions, including how ISVs influence arboviruses through interference, or facilitation.
- Exploring the role of RNA interference (RNAi) in shaping these interactions.
