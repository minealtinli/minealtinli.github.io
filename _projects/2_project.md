            Mosquitoes not only transmit pathogenic viruses to other animals, but also are hosts for a rich microbiota.

            Mosquitoes are complex systems where viruses, bacteria, and other microbes interact, shaping the mosquito’s biology and its ability to transmit disease.
            At the organism level, my research investigates how insect-specific viruses (ISVs) interact with the broader microbial environment inside mosquitoes—such as arboviruses and bacteria, and the mosquito’s own immune system.
            These interactions determine where ISVs establish themselves, how they persist, and whether they interfere with or facilitate arbovirus infections.

            <ul>
                <li>Some ISVs and arboviruses are phylogenetically close but take very different paths: while arboviruses replicate in mosquitoes and are transmitted to vertebrate hosts, ISVs remain restricted to insect hosts. What drives this difference? Do ISVs specialize in certain tissues or escape immune responses in ways that make them persistent rather than transmissible?</li>
                <li>Where do ISVs persist, and how does this influence arboviruses? Are ISVs and arboviruses competing for the same resources or tissues? If they co-infect the same organs, does one restrict or facilitate the other?</li>
                <li>Could ISVs indirectly influence arbovirus transmission by modifying mosquito metabolism, immune signaling, or tissue integrity?</li>
            </ul>
