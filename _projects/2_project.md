      Mosquitoes not only transmit pathogenic viruses to other animals, but also are hosts for a rich microbiota.

      Arboviruses, insect-specific viruses (ISVs), and a diverse microbiota interact within mosquitoes, across tissues and sometimes through modulation of the immune pathways. These interactions could shape viral persistence and ultimately the transmission potential of different pathogens. Exploring these dynamics offers insight into how viruses establish themselves, how microbial partners influence each other, and why some viruses remain insect-restricted while others do not.

    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li><strong>Tissue tropism and persistence:</strong> What determines the tissue tropism and persistence of viruses within mosquitoes? How do immune responses or microbial competition shape where arboviruses and ISVs replicate?</li>
      <li><strong>Systemic immunity:</strong> How does systemic immunity work in mosquitoes? </li>
      <li><strong>Co-infection dynamics:</strong> How do ISVs and arboviruses compete or coexist within the same host? If they co-infect the same tissues, does one facilitate or restrict the other? Do they alter mosquito metabolism or immune signaling in ways that affect transmission?</li>
      <li><strong>Systemic interactions and communication:</strong> Do different microbial or viral partners communicate systemically within the mosquito? Are shared immune pathways or molecular signals involved in cross-talk between viruses, or between viruses and bacteria?</li>
