  abstract = {Mosquito-specific viruses (MSVs) are a subset of insect-specific viruses that are found to infect mosquitoes or mosquito derived cells. There has been an increase in discoveries of novel MSVs in recent years. This has expanded our understanding of viral diversity and evolution but has also sparked questions concerning the transmission of these viruses and interactions with their hosts and its microbiome. In fact, there is already evidence that MSVs interact with the immune system of their host. This is especially interesting, since mosquitoes can be infected with both MSVs and arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses of public health concern. In this review, we give an update on the different MSVs discovered so far and describe current data on their transmission and interaction with the mosquito immune system as well as the effect MSVs could have on an arboviruses-coinfection. Lastly, we discuss potential uses of these viruses, including vector and transmission control.},

  abstract = {The inadequacy of standard mosquito control strategies calls for ecologically safe novel approaches, for example the use of biological agents such as the endosymbiotic α-proteobacteria Wolbachia or insect-specific viruses (ISVs). Understanding the ecological interactions between these “biocontrol endosymbionts” is thus a fundamental step. Wolbachia are transmitted vertically from mother to offspring and modify their hosts’ phenotypes, including reproduction (e.g., cytoplasmic incompatibility) and survival (e.g., viral interference). In nature, Culex pipiens (sensu lato) mosquitoes are always found infected with genetically diverse Wolbachia called wPip that belong to five phylogenetic groups. In recent years, ISVs have also been discovered in these mosquito species, although their interactions with Wolbachia in nature are unknown. Here, we studied the interactions between a widely prevalent ISV, the Culex pipiens densovirus (CpDV, Densovirinae), and Wolbachia in northern Tunisian C. pipiens populations. We showed an influence of different Wolbachia groups on CpDV prevalence and a general positive correlation between Wolbachia and CpDV loads. By investigating the putative relationship between CpDV diversification and wPip groups in the different sites, we detected a signal linked to wPip groups in CpDV phylogeny in sites where all larvae were infected by the same wPip group. However, no such signal was detected where the wPip groups coexisted, suggesting CpDV horizontal transfer between hosts. Overall, our results provide good evidence for an ecological influence of Wolbachia on an ISV, CpDV, in natural populations and highlight the importance of integrating Wolbachia in our understanding of ISV ecology in nature.},

  abstract = {Mosquitoes not only transmit human and veterinary pathogens called arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) but also harbor mosquito-associated insect-speciﬁc viruses (mosquito viruses) that cannot infect vertebrates. In the past, studies investigating mosquito viruses mainly focused on highly pathogenic interactions that were easier to detect than those without visible symptoms. However, the recent advances in viral metagenomics have highlighted the abundance and diversity of viruses which do not generate mass mortality in host populations. Over the last decade, this has facilitated the rapid growth of virus discovery in mosquitoes. The circumstances around the discovery of mosquito viruses greatly affected how they have been studied so far. While earlier research mainly focused on the pathogenesis caused by DNA and some doublestranded RNA viruses during larval stages, more recently discovered single-stranded RNA mosquito viruses were heavily studied for their putative interference with arboviruses in female adults. Thus, many aspects of mosquito virus interactions with their hosts and host-microbiota are still unknown. In this context, considering mosquito viruses as endosymbionts can help to identify novel research areas, in particular in relation to their long-term interactions with their hosts (e.g. relationships during all life stages, the stability of the associations at evolutionary scales, transmission routes and virulence evolution) and the possible context-dependent range of interactions (i.e. beneﬁcial to antagonistic). Here, we review the symbiotic interactions of mosquito viruses considering different aspects of their ecology, such as transmission, host speciﬁcity, host immune system and interactions with other symbionts within the host cellular arena. Finally, we highlight related research gaps in mosquito virus research.},

  abstract = {In arthropods, Wolbachia endosymbionts induce conditional sterility, called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), resulting from embryonic lethality. CI penetrance (i.e., embryonic death rate) varies depending on host species and Wolbachia strains involved. All Culex pipiens mosquitoes are infected by the endosymbiotic alphaproteobacteria Wolbachia wPip. CI in Culex, characterized as a binary “compatible/incompatible” phenomenon, revealed an unparalleled diversity of patterns linked to the ampliﬁcation-diversiﬁcation of cidA and cidB genes. Here, we accurately studied CI penetrance variations in the light of cid genes divergence by generating a C. pipiens compatibility matrix between 11 lines hosting different phylogenetic wPip groups and exhibiting distinct cid gene repertoires. We showed, as expected, that crosses involving wPip from the same group were mostly compatible. In contrast, only 22\% of the crosses involving different wPip groups were compatible, while 54\% were fully incompatible. For the remaining 24\% of the crosses, “intermediate” compatibilities were reported, and a cytological observation of the ﬁrst zygotic division conﬁrmed the occurrence of “canonical” CI phenotypes in a fraction of the eggs. Backcross experiments demonstrated that intermediate compatibilities were not linked to host genetic background but to the Wolbachia strains involved. This previously unstudied intermediate penetrance CI was more severe and frequent in crosses involving wPip-IV strains exhibiting cid variants markedly divergent from other wPip groups. Our data demonstrate that CI is not always a binary compatible/incompatible phenomenon in C. pipiens but that intermediate compatibilities putatively resulting from partial mismatch due to Cid proteins divergence exist in this species complex.},

  abstract = {Arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes are responsible for the death of millions of people each year. In addition to arboviruses, many insect-speciﬁc viruses (ISVs) have been discovered in mosquitoes in the last decade. ISVs, in contrast to arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes to vertebrates, cannot replicate in vertebrate cells even when they are evolutionarily closely related to arboviruses. The alphavirus genus includes many arboviruses, although only a few ISVs have been discovered from this genus so far. Here, we investigate the interactions of a recently isolated insect-speciﬁc alphavirus, Agua Salud alphavirus (ASALV), with its mosquito host. RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the essential antiviral responses against arboviruses, although there is little knowledge on the interactions of RNAi with ISVs. Through the knockdown of transcripts of the different key RNAi pathway (small interfering RNA [siRNA], microRNA [miRNA], and P-element-induced wimpy testis [PIWI]-interacting RNA [piRNA]) proteins, we show the antiviral role of Ago2 (siRNA), Ago1 (miRNA), and Piwi4 proteins against ASALV in Aedes aegypti-derived cells. ASALV replication was increased in Dicer2 and Ago2 knockout cells, conﬁrming the antiviral role of the siRNA pathway. In infected cells, mainly ASALV-speciﬁc siRNAs are produced, while piRNA-like small RNAs, with the characteristic nucleotide bias resulting from ping-pong ampliﬁcation, are produced only in Dicer2 knockout cells. Taken together, ASALV interactions with the mosquito RNAi response differ from those of arthropod-borne alphaviruses in some aspects, although they also share some commonalities. Further research is needed to understand whether the identiﬁed differences can be generalized to other insect-speciﬁc alphaviruses.},

So far, our understanding of parvovirus diversity is biased towards medically or economically important viruses mainly infecting vertebrate hosts, while invertebrate infecting parvoviruses—namely densoviruses—have been largely neglected. Here, we investigated the prevalence and the evolution of the only mosquito-infecting ambidensovirus, Culex pipiens densovirus (CpDV), from laboratory mosquito lines and natural populations collected worldwide. CpDV diversity generally grouped in two clades, here named CpDV-1 and -2. The incongruence of the different gene trees for some samples suggested the possibility of recombination events between strains from different clades. We further investigated the role of selection on the evolution of CpDV genome and detected many individual sites under purifying selection both in non-structural and structural genes. However, some sites in structural genes were under diversifying selection, especially during the divergence of CpDV-1 and -2 clades. These substitutions between CpDV-1 and -2 clades were mostly located in the capsid protein encoding region and might cause changes in host speciﬁcity or pathogenicity of CpDV strains from the two clades. However, additional functional and experimental studies are necessary to fully understand the protein conformations and the resulting phenotype of these substitutions between clades of CpDV.},

Its transmission from host to host, the nature of its interactions with both its host and host’s endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia are not known. Here, we report the presence of CpDV in the ovaries and eggs of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes in close encounters with Wolbachia. In the ovaries, CpDV amount signiﬁcantly differed between mosquito lines harbouring different strains of Wolbachia and these differences were not linked to variations in Wolbachia densities. CpDV was vertically transmitted in all laboratory lines to 17\%–20\% of the offspring. For some females, however, the vertical transmission reached 90\%. Antibiotic treatment that cured the host from Wolbachia signiﬁcantly decreased both CpDV quantity and vertical transmission suggesting an impact of host microbiota, including Wolbachia, on CpDV transmission. Overall our results show that CpDV is transmitted vertically via transovarian path along with Wolbachia with which it shares the same cells. Our results are primordial to understand the dynamics of densovirus infection, their persistence and spread in populations considering their potential use in the regulation of mosquito vector populations.},

  abstract = {Wolbachia is a vertically transmitted endosymbiont whose radiative success is mainly related to various host reproductive manipulations that led to consider this symbiont as a conﬂictual reproductive parasite. However, lately, some Wolbachia have been shown to act as beneﬁcial symbionts by protecting hosts against a broad range of parasites. Still, this protection has been mostly demonstrated in artiﬁcial Wolbachia-host associations between partners that did not co-evolved together. Here, we tested in two terrestrial isopod species Armadillidium vulgare and Porcellio dilatatus whether resident Wolbachia (native or non-native) could confer protection during infections with Listeria ivanovii and Salmonella typhimurium and also during a transinfection with a Wolbachia strain that kills the recipient host (i.e., wVulC in P. dilatatus). Survival analyses showed that (i) A. vulgare lines hosting their native Wolbachia (wVulC) always exhibited higher survival than asymbiotic ones when infected with pathogenic bacteria (ii) P. dilatatus lines hosting their native wDil Wolbachia strain survived the S. typhimurium infection better, while lines hosting non-native wCon Wolbachia strain survived the L. ivanovii and also the transinfection with wVulC from A. vulgare better. By studying L. ivanovii and S. typhimurium loads in the hemolymph of the different host-Wolbachia systems, we showed that (i) the difference in survival between lines after L. ivanovii infections were not linked to the difference between their pathogenic bacterial loads, and (ii) the difference in survival after S. typhimurium infections corresponds to lower loads of pathogenic bacteria. Overall, our results demonstrate a beneﬁcial effect of Wolbachia on survival of terrestrial isopods when infected with pathogenic intracellular bacteria. This protective effect may rely on different mechanisms depending on the resident symbiont and the invasive bacteria interacting together within the hosts.},

  abstract = {Background: Wolbachia are maternally transmitted bacteria that can manipulate their hosts’ reproduction causing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI is a sperm-egg incompatibility resulting in embryonic death. Due to this sterilising effect on mosquitoes, Wolbachia are considered for vector control strategies. Important vectors for arboviruses, filarial nematodes and avian malaria, mosquitoes of Culex pipiens complex are suitable for Wolbachia-based vector control. They are infected with Wolbachia wPip strains belonging to five genetically distinct groups (wPip-I to V) within the Wolbachia B supergroup. CI properties of wPip strongly correlate with this genetic diversity: mosquitoes infected with wPip strains from a different wPip group are more likely to be incompatible with each other. Turkey is a critical spot for vector-borne diseases due to its unique geographical position as a natural bridge between Asia, Europe and Africa. However, general wPip diversity, distribution and CI patterns in natural Cx. pipiens (s.l.) populations in the region are unknown. In this study, we first identified wPip diversity in Turkish Cx. pipiens (s.l.) populations, by assigning them to one of the five groups within wPip (wPip-Ito V). We further investigated CI properties between different wPip strains from this region.
Results: We showed a wPip fixation in Cx. pipiens (s.l.) populations in Turkey by analysing 753 samples from 59 sampling sites. Three wPip groups were detected in the region: wPip-I, wPip-II and wPip-IV. The most dominant group was wPip-II. While wPip-IV was restricted to only two locations, wPip-I and wPip-II had wider distributions. Individuals infected with wPip-II were found co-existing with individuals infected with wPip-I or wPip-IV in some sampling sites. Two mosquito isofemale lines harbouring either a wPip-I or a wPip-II strain were established from a population in northwestern Turkey. Reciprocal crosses between these lines showed that they were fully compatible with each other but bidirectionally incompatible with wPip-IV Istanbul infected line.
Conclusion: Our findings reveal a high diversity of wPip and CI properties in Cx. pipiens (s.l.) populations in Turkey. Knowledge on naturally occurring CI patterns caused by wPip diversity in Turkey might be useful for Cx. pipiens (s.l.) control in the region.},

In the present study, we investigated the infection and dissemination of the Agua Salud alphavirus (ASALV) in the important mosquito vector Aedes aegypti through different infection routes (per oral infection, intrathoracic injection) and its transmission. We show here that ASALV infects the female Ae. aegypti and replicates when mosquitoes are infected intrathoracically or orally. ASALV disseminated to different tissues, including the midgut, salivary glands and ovaries. However, we observed a higher virus load in the brain than in the salivary glands and carcasses, suggesting a tropism towards brain tissues. Our results show that ASALV is transmitted horizontally during adult and larval stages, although we did not observe vertical transmission.

  abstract = {Since its detection in 2015 in Brazil, Zika virus (ZIKV) has remained in the spotlight of international public health and research as an emerging arboviral pathogen. In addition to single infection, ZIKV may occur in co-infection with dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses, with whom ZIKV shares geographic distribution and the mosquito Aedes aegypti as a vector. The main mosquito immune response against arboviruses is RNA interference (RNAi). It is unknown whether or not the dynamics of the RNAi response differ between single arboviral infections and co-infections. In this study, we investigated the interaction of ZIKV and DENV, as well as ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections with the RNAi response in Ae. aegypti. Using small RNA sequencing, we found that the efficiency of small RNA production against ZIKV -a hallmark of antiviral RNAi—was mostly similar when comparing single and co-infections with either DENV or CHIKV. Silencing of key antiviral RNAi proteins, showed no change in effect on ZIKV replication when the cell is co-infected with ZIKV and DENV or CHIKV. Interestingly, we observed a negative effect on ZIKV replication during CHIKV coinfection in the context of Ago2-knockout cells, though his effect was absent during DENV co-infection. Overall, this study provides evidence that ZIKV single or co-infections with CHIKV or DENV are equally controlled by RNAi responses. Thus, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and derived cells support co-infections of ZIKV with either CHIKV or DENV to a similar level than single infections, as long as the RNAi response is functional.},

  abstract = {Background  Mosquito-specific viruses (MSVs) comprise a variety of different virus families, some of which are known to interfere with infections of medically important arboviruses. Viruses belonging to the family Mesoniviridae or taxon Negevirus harbor several insect-specific viruses, including MSVs, which are known for their wide geographical distri‑bution and extensive host ranges. Although these viruses are regularly identified in mosquitoes all over the world, their presence in mosquitoes in Germany had not yet been reported.
Methods  A mix of three MSVs (Yichang virus [Mesoniviridae] and two negeviruses [Daeseongdong virus and Dezi‑dougou virus]) in a sample that contained a pool of Coquillettidia richiardii mosquitoes collected in Germany was used to investigate the interaction of these viruses with different arboviruses in Culex-derived cells. In addition, small RNA sequencing and analysis of different mosquito-derived cells infected with this MSV mix were performed.
Results  A strain of Yichang virus (Mesoniviridae) and two negeviruses (Daeseongdong virus and Dezidougou virus) were identified in the Cq. richiardii mosquitoes sampled in Germany, expanding current knowledge of their circula‑tion in central Europe. Infection of mosquito-derived cells with these three viruses revealed that they are targeted by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway. In Culex-derived cells, co-infection by these three viruses had vary‑ing effects on the representative arboviruses from different virus families (Togaviridae: Semliki forest virus [SFV]; Bunyavirales: Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus [BUNV]; or Flaviviridae: Usutu virus [USUV]). Specifically, persistent MSV co-infection inhibited BUNV infection, as well as USUV infection (but the latter only at specific time points). However, the impact on SFV infection was only noticeable at low multiplicity of infection (MOI 0.1) and at specific time points in combination with the infection status.
Conclusions  Taken together, these results are important findings that will lead to a better understanding of the com‑plex interactions of MSVs, mosquitoes and arboviruses.},

            Understanding how life is adapting to urban environments represents an important challenge in evolutionary biology. Here we investigate a widely cited example of urban adaptation,
            Culex pipiens
            form
            molestus
            , also known as the London Underground Mosquito. Population genomic analysis of ∼350 contemporary and historical samples counter the popular hypothesis that
            molestus
            originated belowground in London less than 200 years ago. Instead, we show that
            molestus
            first adapted to human environments aboveground in the Middle East over the course of {\textgreater}1000 years, likely in concert with the rise of agricultural civilizations. Our results highlight the role of early human society in priming taxa for contemporary urban evolution and have important implications for understanding arbovirus transmission.},

However, postdoctoral researchers are often overlooked or misrepresented as a homogeneous group of researchers. The principal aim of the Leibniz PostDoc Survey was to understand who Leibniz PostDocs are and to provide some insight into their experiences, interests, and needs. This report summarises the results of the second Leibniz PostDoc Survey, which was open for submission from November 2022 to January 2023. Overall, we had questions covering the following sections: (1) demographics, (2) contract and payments, (3) working hours and tasks, (4) career goals, (5) career development – experiences, (6) career development – supervisor and institutional support, (7) satisfaction and working situation, (8) good scientific practice, workplace conflict, and discrimination, (9) mental health, as well as (10) the experience of international Leibniz PostDocs.

While its enzootic transmission cycle is not well investigated, its pattern of disappearance and ree­ mergence suggests overlooked but critical wildlife reservoirs. While ONNV travel-related cases were reported in Canada and Germany, autochthonous transmission is limited to sub-Saharan Africa. The lack of specialised vectors, such as anopheline mosquitoes, is considered to be one of the reasons. Here, we investigated the vector competence of native and invasive culicine mosquitoes from Germany. While the tested native culicine mosquitoes from Germany did not transmit ONNV, our results provide experimental evidence for potential ONNV transmission by invasive Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. We further investigated the role of temperature on ONNV transmission. Ae. albopictus mosquitoes are highly invasive and have become widespread in Europe in the last decade. Our results highlight that, combined with rising summer temperatures and the abundance of competent vectors, ONNV may emerge as a public health threat for Europe in the near future.},
